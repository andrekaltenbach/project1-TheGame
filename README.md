# README Project 1 - The Grand Heist

---

- Description
  The goal of the project was to develop a browser game. For the content and the layout of the displayed elements HTML and CSS was used. The game logic was implemented using JavaScript only without any third-party modules.
  The Grand Heist is a homage to 1980s arcade games with pixelated graphics and 8-bit-like sound.

- Instructions to play
  You are on the grand heist! Collect all the gold you can get but don't get busted by the police.

  The player moves automatically forward. You can navigate left/right/up/down with the arrow keys on your keyboard. If you left the pitch, the player will appear on the opposite site of the pith moving in the same direction. Gold but also police persons are generated every two seconds at random position. There is a maximum of three gold and, in level 1, five police persons. With increasing level also the number of police persons increases.
  If you hit gold you collect 10000 points. If you hit the police you get busted and the game is over.
